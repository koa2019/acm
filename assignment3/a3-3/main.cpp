/* C. Highest Frequency Element
 * 
 * Given an array of size n, find which element occurs the most in the array. 
 * If two elements are tied for the highest frequency, the answer is the one with the higher value.
   Input:
        * The first line of input contains 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 20), the number of queries to answer.
        * The first line of each query contains 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100), the size of the array.
        * On the next line there will be 𝑛 numbers.
        * The 𝑖-th number contains 𝑎𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 100) , the value of the 𝑖-th element.
Output:
 * For each query, first output the value of the element that occurs the most times, then print its frequency on the same line.
